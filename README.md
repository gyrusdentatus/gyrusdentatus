#### **NOTE**: This is a draft and a shitty markdown now
- 👋 Hi, I’m Hans, aka @gyrusdentatus , someone who got into the field by an accidently running Wireshark a few years ago. Former bgr neuroscience. 
- 👀 I’m interested in hacking everything that exists either in the digital world or physical. being a hacker is simply a mindset. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everything, but I guess the biggest challenge is to keep track of your previous work so you could get back to it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... currently mainly on nymtech.net and mixnets and also anything related to privacy, infosec, identity, networking, opsec, microcontrollers, ARM, RISC-V ...
